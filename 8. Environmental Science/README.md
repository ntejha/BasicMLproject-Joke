# Environmental Science Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Environmental Science Machine Learning Project section! This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to address challenges and tasks within the environmental science domain.

## Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning in Python

### Description
This project aims to predict rainfall patterns based on historical weather data and environmental factors. Machine learning models are trained on past rainfall data to forecast future precipitation levels accurately.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical weather data, including rainfall measurements, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other environmental variables. The dataset is preprocessed and transformed into a format suitable for training machine learning models.

### Tools and Libraries
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for demonstration)

### Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Environmental_Science/Rainfall_Prediction` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb`) to explore the project.
4. Follow the instructions and code comments within the notebook to run the code and analyze the results.

### Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be applied to predict rainfall patterns accurately. By leveraging historical weather data and environmental factors, we can improve our understanding of precipitation dynamics and enhance our ability to forecast future rainfall events.
