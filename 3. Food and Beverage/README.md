# Food and Beverage Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Food and Beverage Machine Learning Project section! This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using machine learning techniques.

## Wine Quality Prediction

### Description
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. The dataset contains features such as acidity levels, pH, alcohol content, and more, which are used to predict the quality rating of wine samples.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Wine Quality" dataset, which is publicly available and can be found on platforms like Kaggle. It consists of red and white variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine samples, with various chemical properties and a quality rating assigned by experts.

### Tools and Libraries
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for demonstration)

### Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Food_and_Beverage/Wine_Quality_Prediction` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb`) to explore the project.
4. Follow the instructions and code comments within the notebook to run the code and analyze the results.

### Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to demonstrate how machine learning algorithms can be applied to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical composition. By leveraging the power of data science, we can assist winemakers and enthusiasts in understanding and improving wine quality.
