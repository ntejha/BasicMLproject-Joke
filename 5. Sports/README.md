# Sports Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Sports Machine Learning Project section! This project focuses on predicting the scores of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using deep learning techniques.

## IPL Score Prediction Using Deep Learning

### Description
This project aims to predict the scores of IPL matches based on historical match data, player statistics, and match conditions. Deep learning models are trained on past IPL match data to learn patterns and relationships between various factors affecting match scores.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical IPL match data, including match details, player performances, and match outcomes. The dataset is preprocessed and transformed into a format suitable for training deep learning models.

### Tools and Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (for demonstration)

### Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Sports/IPL_Score_Prediction` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`IPL_Score_Prediction.ipynb`) to explore the project.
4. Follow the instructions and code comments within the notebook to run the code and analyze the results.

### Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to demonstrate how deep learning techniques can be applied to predict the scores of IPL matches with high accuracy. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, we can assist cricket enthusiasts and sports analysts in making informed predictions and analyzing match outcomes.
